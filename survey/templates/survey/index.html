        <p>Walk/Ride Days take place on the last Friday of each month, and provide a shared day for everyone in the community to celebrate, try out, or just think about healthy, environmentally sustainable commuting options.</p>

        <p>Donâ€™t work on Fridays? Check in your commute for another day! You can check in as early as the Monday prior or as late as the Monday after Walk/Ride Day.</p>
